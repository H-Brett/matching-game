# matching-game
Attempt to create a vanilla JS matching game from scratch. 


Additional things to be done / issues: 

-create game complete

  -stop timer / show time taken
  
  -show move count
  
-reset button should probably be more than an image of a reset button

-option for card count, probably also need to change image / card size

  -optimization of images, currently ~2s loadtime
  


-currently if you click things to rapidly and it seems to be if you also click the same card multiple times the whole game div will flip with slightly comical results. 

  -reconfigure functionality to only allow two cards active at the same time?
